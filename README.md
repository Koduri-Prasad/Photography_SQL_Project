# Photography Studio Management System - SQL Project

This project is a **SQL-based database system** designed to manage photography studio operations such as customer bookings, shoot types, photographers, and assignments. It's perfect for hands-on learning of **SQL joins** and practicing complex queries.

---

##  Technologies Used

- ðŸ’¾ **MySQL**  
- ðŸ“„ Raw SQL Queries  
- ðŸ”— Joins: INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, FULL (UNION), SELF JOIN

---

## Database Design Overview

The system consists of the following tables:
- **Customers** â€“ Stores client info
- **Shoot_Types** â€“ Wedding, Pre-Wedding, Portfolio, Baby, etc.
- **Bookings** â€“ Booking info including date and status
- **Photographers** â€“ Photographer details with experience and specialization
- **Shoot_Assignments** â€“ Mapping bookings with photographers

---

##  Key SQL Features Practiced

- âœ… INNER JOIN queries to combine bookings with customer and shoot details  
- âœ… LEFT JOINs to show unmatched records (e.g., unassigned photographers)  
- âœ… RIGHT JOINs for reverse unmatched data  
- âœ… FULL JOIN simulated using `UNION`  
- âœ… SELF JOIN to compare photographers with same experience  
- âœ… GROUP BY with `COUNT()` and `HAVING`  
- âœ… Filtering with `WHERE` clauses
